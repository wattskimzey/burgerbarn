# VIDEO WALK THROUGH
[Feed your eyeballs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TrH5qsvlyZBL9FGER_aWs4VAxUCwlaIB/view).

## Description
Burgerbarn is supposed to track the burgers you eat - but it sorta kinda does and sorta kinda doesn't.  The database is logging the burgers but the front end isn't.  
* PROS: Perfect weight loss tracker for liars.
* CONS: If you actually wish to accurately track your burger intake, you may have to pay zeros of dollars for the free version of MyFitnessPal.  

## Motivation
Attempting to finish bootcamp homework

## Results
Again, it's important to temper failure with perspective.  the front end is an abyssmal failure; yet in that failure there is truimph.  Who really wants to track how many burgers they actually eat? The number of drive-throughs available answers that question - not a whole bunch.   

## Team Efforts
* layout - ME
* coding - ME
* Gittin' the hub - ME
* Everything else - ME

### Challenges
Literally - almost there - and then faceplant.  I'm looking at the burgers increment on the back end and the front end blankly stares at me.  Fine, I don't want a burger anyways, I'm going to have a BLT. 

## Improvements
* front end, fer sure
* post bootcamp rest and relaxation
